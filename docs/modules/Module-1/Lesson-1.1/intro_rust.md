#### **Introduction to Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Move**  

#### **📌 Overview**  
In this lesson, we’ll explore the differences between **Java, JavaScript, Rust, and Move**, and why we are using **Rust and Move for the Sui blockchain** instead of JavaScript.

### **1️⃣ Java vs JavaScript vs Rust vs Move**
| **Feature**            | **Java**                      | **JavaScript**               | **Rust**                        | **Move** (Sui)                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Execution Model** | Compiled → JVM (Bytecode) | Interpreted → Node.js/Browser | Compiled → Native Binary/WASM | Compiled → Sui VM (Bytecode) |
| **Usage** | Backend (Web APIs, Enterprise) | Frontend (Web) & Backend (Node.js) | Blockchain, System Programming, WASM | Smart Contracts on Sui |
| **Memory Management** | Automatic (Garbage Collector) | Automatic (Garbage Collector) | Manual (Ownership, Borrowing) | Similar to Rust (Safe Transactions) |
| **Concurrency** | Multi-threaded | Single-threaded Event Loop | Multi-threaded (Async/Await) | Resource-based Parallel Execution |
| **Blockchain Usage** | Rare | Common (dApp frontends) | Ideal (Sui, Solana, Polkadot) | Native to Sui Blockchain |

### **2️⃣ Why Use Rust Instead of JavaScript for Sui Blockchain?**
JavaScript (`sui.js`) is commonly used in blockchain, but **Rust is superior** because:
✅ **Better performance** – Rust compiles to **native binaries**, making blockchain operations faster.  
✅ **No Node.js dependencies** – We avoid unnecessary **JavaScript/Node.js runtime issues**.  
✅ **Memory safety** – Rust **prevents runtime errors and security vulnerabilities**.  
✅ **Direct Sui blockchain integration** – Rust interacts natively with **Move smart contracts**.

### **3️⃣ Why Move is Perfect for Sui Blockchain**
**Move** is a **Rust-inspired** smart contract language designed for **safe, scalable blockchain transactions**.

**Move’s Key Features:**
- **Resource-oriented programming**: Ensures that **assets (coins, NFTs, tokens) cannot be copied or double-spent**.
- **Memory safety**: Similar to Rust, Move enforces strict **ownership and borrowing rules**.
- **Custom modules**: Move **smart contracts** are structured in **modules** for better security.

📌 **Next Lesson**: Installing **Rust & Sui CLI** in `rust_setup.md`.
