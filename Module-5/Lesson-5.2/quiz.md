# Module 1: Introduction to Rust & Move

## üìå Overview
This module introduces **Rust, Move, and their role in blockchain development**. You‚Äôll learn key differences between JavaScript, Rust, and Move, followed by hands-on coding exercises.

## **üìñ Concept: Java vs JavaScript vs Rust vs Move**
### **Java**
- **Compiled language**, runs on **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**.
- Used in **enterprise applications, Android development, and backend systems**.
- **Object-oriented** with automatic garbage collection.

### **JavaScript**
- **Interpreted language**, runs in browsers or **Node.js**.
- Used for **frontend development, backend APIs (Node.js), and blockchain interactions**.
- **Dynamically typed** with event-driven execution.

### **Rust**
- **Compiled to native machine code** with **no garbage collector**.
- Ideal for **high-performance, secure, and memory-safe applications**.
- Used in **blockchain, system programming, and WebAssembly (WASM) applications**.

### **Move (Sui Blockchain)**
- **Resource-oriented language** for secure **smart contracts**.
- Designed to **prevent double-spending and ensure ownership security**.
- Used exclusively in **Sui blockchain** for decentralized applications.

‚úÖ **Why Use Rust & Move in Blockchain?**
- **Rust provides memory safety** without a garbage collector.
- **Move enforces ownership rules** to prevent reentrancy attacks.
- **Both are faster, more secure alternatives to JavaScript-based blockchain tools**.

## **üìù Quiz: JavaScript vs Rust vs Move**
### **Question 1:**
What is the key difference between JavaScript and Rust in memory management?
- [ ] JavaScript uses a borrow checker.
- [ ] Rust uses ownership rules instead of garbage collection.
- [ ] Both JavaScript and Rust use manual memory allocation.
- [ ] Rust requires Node.js to execute.

### **Question 2:**
Which language is **resource-oriented** and prevents asset duplication?
- [ ] Java
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] Move
- [ ] Rust

### **Question 3:**
What command compiles a Move smart contract?
- [ ] `cargo build`
- [ ] `sui move build`
- [ ] `rustc contract.rs`
- [ ] `sui execute`
