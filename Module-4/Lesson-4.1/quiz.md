# Module 4: Replacing Node.js in Move Smart Contract Development

## 📌 Overview
This module explores how to **deploy Move smart contracts** on the Sui blockchain using **Rust and `cargo-move` instead of `sui.js`**. We will replace Node.js-based workflows with Rust-native solutions for **security, efficiency, and performance**.

---

## **📖 Concept: Deploying Move Contracts with `cargo-move`**
### **Why Move Smart Contracts Require Deployment Tools?**
- Move contracts **define and enforce blockchain rules**.
- `sui.js` provides JavaScript-based tools for contract deployment.
- **Rust-based `cargo-move` eliminates Node.js dependencies** for Move contract deployment.

### **Problems with `sui.js` for Move Deployment**
❌ **Requires Node.js**, which adds unnecessary dependencies.
❌ **Less secure**, as JavaScript is prone to supply chain attacks.
❌ **Slower execution**, since JavaScript is interpreted rather than compiled.

### **Why Use `cargo-move` Instead?**
✅ **Faster Deployment:** Rust compiles to **native binaries**, ensuring efficient execution.
✅ **Memory-Safe:** Rust’s **ownership model prevents runtime vulnerabilities**.
✅ **Direct Integration:** Rust can interact with **Sui blockchain smart contracts** without JavaScript.

## **📝 Quiz: Understanding `cargo-move` vs `sui.js`**
### **Question 1:**
What is the primary advantage of using `cargo-move` over `sui.js`?
- [ ] `cargo-move` requires fewer lines of code
- [ ] `sui.js` is more secure
- [ ] `cargo-move` removes the need for Node.js dependencies
- [ ] `sui.js` compiles Move contracts faster

### **Question 2:**
What command is used to deploy a Move smart contract with Rust?
- [ ] `cargo build`
- [ ] `rustc move_contract.rs`
- [ ] `cargo move publish`
- [ ] `sui move execute`

### **Question 3:**
Which of the following is **not** a reason to replace `sui.js`?
- [ ] JavaScript is prone to security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Rust provides better performance and safety
- [ ] `sui.js` lacks Move contract support
- [ ] Rust cannot interact with the Sui blockchain
